---The 2015 Top Five Programming Languages---

The big five—Java, C, C++, Python, and C#—remain on top, with their ranking undisturbed, but C has edged to within a whisper of knocking Java off the top spot.

==============================
Comparison of C Sharp and Java

Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly, and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed with semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, both use garbage-collection, and both are "curly brace languages" like C and C++.

==============================
The difference between C# and C++

C# is a programming language that is derived from C programming language and C++ programming language. C# is uniquely designed to be used in .NET platform.

C# a high level language that is component oriented.

C++ is a low level and indeed platform neutral programming language.

When compiled, C# code is converted into Intermediate language code. This intermediate language code is converted into executable code through the process called Just-In-Time compilation.

When compiled, C++ code is converted into assembly language code.

==============================
Differences between C and C#

C programming language is more suitable for system programming apps, hardware apps, embedded device and chip designing. While C# is suitable for apps development and web apps development.
Both C and C# deals in four basic data type like int, float, double and char. C# has one addition data type feature Booleans, which is used to shows the output of logical operations.
Total 32 keywords are used in C programming language while in C# total 87 keywords are used.
C# has more integral type as compare to C. There is only one type of integral in C, which are two in C#, char type and whole number which can be signed or unsigned.
C is a structure oriented programming language while C# is an object oriented language.
Top down approach program structure is followed by C while bottom up approach program structure is adopted by C#.

==============================
Differences between C# and Python

Python is winner in: ease of learning, cross platform development, availability of open source libraries
C# is winner in: standard library, language features, development process and tools, performance, language evolution speed
Roughly even: syntax (Python is better in readability, C# has more consistent syntax), adoption.
